In this task you will need to come up with categories to group the text together based on a goal, where each category can be described with a natural language predictate. For example

1. How are you doing?
2. How do I apply for visa?
3. Isn't it ridiculous?
4. How to get there by bus?
5. How is it going?
6. Aren't technological advancement good for the humanity?

Here is our goal: I want to cluster the questions based on their functionalities. Your responses are:
- "employs a rhetorical question; specifically, the text contains a question that is not intended to be answered directly but rather to make a point. For example, 'Is the sky blue?'"
- "serves as a greeting; specifically, the text functions to welcome or acknowledge someone. For example, 'Hello, how are you today?'"
- "seeks practical information; specifically, the text requests useful data or advice to address a specific issue. For example, 'What is the best way to remove a stain from a shirt?'"

(note that all of them need to be natural language predicates that can be validated on individual samples)

Here are some texts:

{samples_in_prompt}

Here is our goal: {goal} Please suggest me a few descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes"". In terms of formatting, each of them needs to be a predicate about a text, followed by an explanation and an example, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"

Do not output anything else. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)
{example_description_in_prompt}

Again, here's the goal: {goal}. Your responses are:
- "
